           Hello there! My name is Liz Perry and I am currently studying to become a Full-Stack Developer! I am beyond excited and nervous 
           to fully immerse myself in this career path, but I hope to showcase my artistic and technical skills all at once! I am very 
           proud of myself for staying persistent throughout this very difficult course but I'm sure my work will speak for itself when 
           completed! 
            </p>
        </div>

        <div id="textCenter">

            I have always had an artistic side, but just never felt comfortable with a paintbrush or a pencil to express myself. Ideas 
            and concepts come to me so easily, but I've never been able to produce my vision. However, since I was little, I've always
            had a knack for technology and would be fascinated with how things work or how to fix them. This sense of curiousity coupled
            with my ability to learn things fairly quickly, has resulted in several years in the IT field. For the past few years I've
            had my artistic side on hold since network security has kept me very busy. However, recently I've realized it just doesn't itch
            that scratch for me anymore and I wanted to learn something new. I stumbled across web development and almost instantly became
            hooked. You're telling me I can create something aesthetically beautiful but also technical and highly functional with coding?
            Yes please! I can have the best of both worlds!
            </p>
            <p>
            So please feel free to browse through my portfolio and check out the work I've created along the way! I hope you enjoy! If you 
            would like to contact me, please feel free to do so through the <a href="contact.html" target="_blank">contact</a> page!
            </p>
