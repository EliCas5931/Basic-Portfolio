           Hello there! My name is Liz Perry and I am currently studying to become a Full-Stack Developer! I am beyond excited and nervous 
           to fully immerse myself in this career path, but I hope to showcase my artistic and technical skills all at once! I am very 
           proud of myself for staying persistent throughout this very difficult course but I'm sure my work will speak for itself when 
           completed! 
        </p>
        <p>
            Please feel free to browse through my work and contact me if you would like to learn more!
        </p>
